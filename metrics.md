####Bad stuff
	1) no of false requests - when buyer presses ignore 
		3 per seller per day is ok, above is not ok
	1.1) when someone sends many requests in a short period of time to different 
		50%+ ignore or cancel rate is suspicious
		more than 100 requests per day is suspicious
	2) € transfered wrong - when somehow buyer -> another seller happens
		measured from complaints
	3) € not transfered - when buyer presses ok but it does not reach seller
		5% is the too much
	4) no of transfers cancelled - when buyer presses cancel
		20%+ is not ok
	5) no of request that don't reach buyer
		5% is too much
